Positive or Negative (0-positive_or_negative.c): This program generates a random number and determines whether it's positive, negative, or zero. It demonstrates the use of conditional statements.

The Last Digit (1-last_digit.c): This program assigns a random number to a variable and prints its last digit along with whether it's greater than 5, equal to 0, or less than 6 and not 0.

Print Alphabet (2-print_alphabet.c): This program prints the lowercase alphabet in a single line using only the putchar function.

Alphabet in Lowercase and Uppercase (3-print_alphabets.c): This program prints the lowercase and uppercase alphabet, separated by a new line, using only the putchar function.

Print Alphabet Without 'q' and 'e' (4-print_alphabt.c): This program prints the lowercase alphabet, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', in a single line using only the putchar function.

Print Single Digit Numbers (5-print_numbers.c): This program prints all single-digit numbers from 0 to 9 in a single line.

Print Single Digit Numbers (6-print_numberz.c): Similar to task 6, this program prints all single-digit numbers from 0 to 9 in a single line, but without using character variables.

Print Reverse Alphabet (7-print_tebahpla.c): This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function.

Print Hexadecimal Numbers (8-print_base16.c): This program prints all the numbers of base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function.

Print Combinations of Two Digits (9-print_comb.c): This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers separated by a comma and a space. It demonstrates the use of nested loops.

Print Combinations of Three Digits (101-print_comb4.c): This program prints all possible combinations of three different single-digit numbers separated by a comma and a space. It demonstrates the use of nested loops.

Print Combinations of Two Two-Digit Numbers (102-print_comb5.c): This program prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers separated by a space and a comma. It demonstrates the use of nested loops and proper formatting.
